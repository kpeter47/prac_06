1. You can comment selected lines of code using the shortcut key Ctrl + /  

2. The single most important design principle for designing functions is probably "the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)." This principle states that a function should do one thing and do it well. A function should have a clear and well-defined purpose.

3. The keyword for returning a value from a function is return. You use the return statement followed by the value you want to return from the function. For example:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

4. Arguments and parameters are related to functions in programming:

Parameters: These are the placeholders or variables defined in the function's declaration. They represent the values that a function expects as input.

Arguments: These are the actual values or expressions that you pass into a function when calling it. 


The difference between parameters and arguments is that parameters are used in the function definition, while arguments are the actual values passed when calling the function.

5. To generate a random number between 1 and 100 in Python, you can use the random module. Here's an example of how to do it:


import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 100)

6. Some common functions used are:
    print(): Used to print output to the console.
    input(): Used to take user input from the console.
    len(): Used to find the length of a string, list, or other iterable.
    str(): Used to convert a value to a string.
